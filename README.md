This is really a space to demonstrate that I know how to be an Analytics Engineer and also tackle some projects that I think are interesting or should just exist.
Right now you'll see that I've started a project that shows WMATA train arrival times. This initially started out as a personal curiosity, but I realized I could kill two birds with one stone (or rather feed to birds with one seed, I heard someone use that in an attempt to sound less violent). What I've done is accessed the live WMATA API and pulled train arrival data every 5 min
